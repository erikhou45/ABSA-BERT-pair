1584	290	I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since. I love it so much. It has come into good use for my finances, scheduling, my parents business expenses, and it is definitely amazing for gaming. The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once, it never slows down. It's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open. It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box. GREAT INVESTMENT!	几个月前，我买了我的Macbook，从那以后一直是我的孩子。我非常喜欢这个。它已经很好地用于我的财务，日程安排，父母的业务费用，对于游戏来说绝对是惊人的。最好的事情是即使一次执行将近十或二十件事，它也不会减慢速度。打开一个程序和打开16个程序一样快。它的工作方式与我将其从包装盒中取出的那一天完全一样。巨大的投资！	I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since.

It is very durable, I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet. I don't do any high tech stuff on it, just write papers, check mail, and sometimes play games, so I can't reccomend it if you are in the computer field. But if you are in the computer field you probably wouldn't be here.:) In the past four years I've had it I have never once gotten a virus. I did have to replace the battery once, but that was only a couple months ago and it's been working perfect ever since. I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use, stylish, fun, awesome computer. Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable, easy to use computer. Hope this helped!	让我们摆脱它吧，我爱苹果！因此，这次审查可能有点偏见。但是Macbook是最好的！超级好用。您所要做的就是打开它，然后它可以工作。它非常耐用，在谈到电子产品时我很粗糙，并且在没有任何重新设计的情况下完成了所有工作。我不做任何高科技的事情，只是写论文，检查邮件，有时玩游戏，所以如果您是计算机领域的人，我将不推荐它。但是，如果您在计算机领域，那么您可能不会在这里。:)在过去的四年中，我从没有感染过病毒。我确实必须更换一次电池，但这只是几个月前，从那时起它一直运行良好。如果您在市场上使用一台易于使用，时尚，有趣，超赞的计算机，我绝对会推荐这种方式。对于只需要可靠，易于使用的计算机的大学生来说，这也非常有用。希望这对您有所帮助！	Let's just get this out of the way, I love Apple!

7128	130	bought notebook 07/2009. in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse. 1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in. returned it. 5 months dead again. They say sorry out of warranty. Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period. Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine. They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything. Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook. So buyer beware when buying Toshiba	购买了笔记本07/2009。在5个月内，连接质量越来越差。他们第一次让它在接下来的5个月内开始运作，他们让我寄回了它。 5个月再次死亡。他们说对不起保修。摘要：在保修期内，他们与我一起玩游戏。现在17个月后，他们希望（不会说确切的金额）将$ 165.00到$ 400修理机器。他们在去年四月让我寄回了机器，五月将它退还给我，但没有任何说明文件。现在，机器无法连接，东芝说他们确实在五月更换了连接卡，但他们只提供30天的维修保修，即使我自购买产品以来已经连续5个月了，但现在我不在保修范围内。上网本。所以买家在购买东芝时要当心	bought notebook 07/2009. in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse. 1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in. returned it. 5 months dead again.

7326	384	I've haven't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off. Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached. I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly. I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem. I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion.	除了笔记本电脑上覆盖USB端口电线的塑料片全部脱落之外，我的笔记本电脑没有遇到任何重大问题。由于它们没有牢固地连接，显然它们是有缺陷的。我几乎不能使用任何USB设备，因为它们无法保持正确连接。我给东芝打了电话，他们希望我在看问题的同时不用笔记本电脑住两个星期。我认为我宁愿遭受一些我认为很容易解决的问题。	I've haven't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off.

10494	374	I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied. The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones. Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it. That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed. It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back. ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke. I babyed the heck out of it and i still do. To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk. The graphics are great. The internet speed is spectacular. The battery life is probably an hour at best. Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good. I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about. I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.	我已经有这台笔记本电脑几个月了，我会说我很满意。唯一的问题是声音不是很大，我必须戴耳机。另一件事是，仅一个月后，鼠标左键坏了，送去修理的费用为175美元。整个体验简直是荒谬的，我们把它寄了出去，在他们告诉我们我们必须支付175美元来修复它之后，我们就像我们会用便宜的便携式鼠标一样，但是他们拒绝将笔记本电脑寄回，直到我们付款为止175美元，它是固定的。我花了2个多星期才拿回来。刚打开一天，就打开了它，然后点击它，结果坏了。我摆脱了困境，但我仍然这样做。老实说，我认为这是设备故障，或者是idk。图形很棒。互联网速度惊人。电池寿命可能最多只有一个小时。哦，它有文字和材料，但是它有试用版，所以大约一个月后，当您打开它时，它会要求提供计算机没有提供的产品密钥，即使单击“取消”，它也不会让您使用我使用的旧文字处理程序效果很好。我会推荐它只是因为互联网的速度，可能是因为那是我真正关心的唯一事情。我希望音量可以更大，并且仅一个月后鼠标就不会折断。	I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied.

12078	52	I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market. I also bought one for my wife, and 3 for my office. They are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat. I burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so I can place it there. I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times. This is what they told me: It heats up, and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops, and simply categorize them as portables. You might think, I am new in this game, but I am a gadget lover, and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years, and none gets this hot, that fast. I also experience the same with my MacBook Air. So you might ask, what did Apple do for me? For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this). Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby. The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times. Sad very SAD.	当一体式产品上市时，我就购买了这款笔记本电脑。我还给妻子买了一个，为办公室买了三个。它们很棒，但是放热时非常危险。我把腿从桌子上抬起后烧了一下，不到五秒钟就放到膝盖上，以清洁咖啡桌，这样就可以放在那里了。我必须给Apple打电话19次（每次打电话40至75分钟），然后将其带到他们的商店进行5次评估和诊断。这就是他们告诉我的：升温，这就是我们不再称其为笔记本电脑，而是将其归类为便携式计算机的原因。您可能会认为，我是这个游戏的新手，但是我是个小玩意儿，在过去15年中拥有超过20台笔记本电脑，但没有一台如此快。我的MacBook Air也有同样的经历。所以你可能会问，苹果为我做了什么？因为我的大腿烧伤了我的皮肤（在7个月前就发生了永久性烙印），所以他们给了我ITouch 8Gig（您知道当一家如此有钱的公司提供像我这样的忠实客户，其产品系列作为此类活动的礼物）。史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）可能需要帮助和捐款，并且无法为真正试图抚养婴儿的人们提供合理的报价。从中吸取的教训是：忠于任何品牌并不能为此付出代价，因为他们所有人都只是为了尽可能快地赚取尽可能多的钱，而在这个时代，客户一直都是正确的。伤心极了。	I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market.

The screen is bright and clear, the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice. Fast, fast and fast, the web pages just fly by. I had my IWORKS, Itunes, Email, MS Office, network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour. That includes transferring my music and movies. Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors!!!! Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too. I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner. My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect, unlike the PCs in our lives. If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job. If your time is worth anything to you, if you are tired of rebooting, reformatting, reinstalling, trying to find drivers, if you want a computer to work for you for a change, make the change to this computer. It is light and the battery last a very long time. Very fast boot up and shut down.	从一开始，当您打开包装盒时，您会看到一类完全不同的机器。您轻松设置所有内容，这样孩子就可以做到。屏幕明亮清晰，对于新手来说操作系统稳定可靠。网页飞快地飞逝。我已经设置了IWORKS，Itunes，电子邮件，MS Office，网络和打印机，并且在一小时内可以完全正常工作。这包括传输我的音乐和电影。再见，蓝色屏幕和严重错误！ Skype在这台机器上也是如此酷。我迫不及待地想看到下一个角落。我的Iphone就像人们期望的那样同步同步，这与我们生活中的PC不同。如果只有比尔·盖茨能读懂这里所说的话，MS会做得更好。如果您的时间对您来说物有所值，则如果您厌倦了重新启动，重新格式化，重新安装，尝试查找驱动程序，并且想要一台能为您工作的计算机进行更改，请对该计算机进行更改。它很轻，电池可以持续很长时间。快速启动和关闭。	From the start, when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine.

13068	273	I'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown. Being a PC user my whole life, it's taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I'm finding my way around. The unibody design is edgy and durable. The LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more. I'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages. Granted, it's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops, my Mac boots up noticeably quicker. A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect. They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular. I'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same. It's more expensive but well worth it in the long run.	我已经迷上了这款笔记本电脑所展现的时尚外观和可靠性。一生都是PC用户，要适应Mac的操作系统需要花费一些时间，但我正在寻找解决方法。一体式设计具有前卫性和耐用性。 LED背光显示屏使我的照片更加流行。我正在学习鼠标垫的手指选项，以便更快地浏览网页。当然，它仍然是一台非常新的笔记本电脑，但是与我以前的笔记本电脑和台式机相比，Mac的启动速度明显更快。使我进入Mac的关键因素是艺术方面。他们开发了出色的专有软件来编辑视频和图片，我期待定期使用这些工具。我很高兴了解更多有关此功能强大的机器所能提供的信息，并鼓励其他人也这样做。它更昂贵，但从长远来看还是值得的。	I'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown.

14454	41	"I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated, but once you get past the initial expense you'll find that they're worth every penny (besides, there's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers). The 13"" MacBook Pro is portable, durable, and very capable. It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours. It's also very energy efficient, running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb. It's graphics aren't bad at all, for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum, easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics. It's also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing). The operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing. Typically, when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience.

It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours. It's also very energy efficient, running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb. It's graphics aren't bad at all, for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum, easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics. It's also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing).

14652	84	"I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for. The 13"" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product. The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great. I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express. Speakers doesn't sound that great. The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack."	我一直在寻找一款便携式且具有我所需要的所有功能的Mac。 13英寸Macbook Pro恰好适合我的预算，并且免费送货，不对CA征收税款，这是我们购买优质产品的最佳价格。Macbook装在一个很好的双包装中，并密封在盒子中，所有功能均有效我会建议任何人从pcconnection Express购买。扬声器听起来并不那么好，电池寿命也跟不上要求，但我仍然认为Macbook在其他产品方面遥遥领先。	"I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for.

15048	372	This a starter notebook. The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing. The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV. If you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core AMD or Intel processor. I would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a Desktop it does not meet the expectations. It is a cheap throw together. Save your money and go for a better device.	这是一个入门笔记本。 2.1 GHz的AMD Semprom处理器实在令人it目结舌，它没有高清或强大计算能力。笔记本电脑缺少一个HDMI端口和一个S-video端口，可以将其连接到电视。如果您进行检查，将会发现具有上述缺少端口和双核AMD或Intel处理器的笔记本电脑。我不建议任何希望笔记本电脑期望台式机性能不符合期望的人使用此功能。这是便宜的东西。省钱，并寻求更好的设备。	This a starter notebook.
