All the newer MacBooks do not. Plus you get 500GB which is also a great feature. Also, the resale value on this will keep. I highly recommend you get one before they are gone.	物超所值，而且对于寻找Macbook的人来说必须购买。没有比这个价格更好的东西了，它带有一个内置磁盘驱动器。所有较新的MacBook都没有。另外，您还可以获得500GB的存储空间，这也是一项很棒的功能。此外，此商品的转售价值将保持不变。我强烈建议您在他们消失之前得到一个。	Excellent value and a must buy for someone looking for a Macbook.

Got this on black friday with a very good discount and couldn't be happier. The screen is great, I don't see the need for a retina display. I also really like the addition of the SD Card slot.	从字面上看，它仍然比我的旧Macbook pro酷得多。老式的一体式Macbook pro可能会在一段时间后煎鸡蛋。在黑色星期五以非常优惠的折扣获得了此商品，再也不会高兴了。屏幕很棒，我看不到需要视网膜显示器。我也非常喜欢添加SD卡插槽。	Literally, it stays much cooler than my old macbook pro.

990	B0074703CM_286_ANONYMOUS	This Macbook Pro is AMAZING! If you are afraid of it not having a disc player please don't be. After not having a disc player I have actually noticed that I never used this disc play in my old laptop either. However if you really need a disc player Apple sells one that connects to your USB port. I love the new high retina display, and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter. Overall, this is a fast, light, practical computer and I highly recommend it.	这款Macbook Pro令人赞叹！如果您担心它没有光盘播放器，请不要这样做。在没有光盘播放器后，我实际上注意到我也从未在旧笔记本电脑中使用过该光盘播放器。但是，如果您真的需要一台光盘播放器，Apple会出售一个连接到USB端口的光盘播放器。我喜欢这种新型的高视网膜显示屏，因为这台计算机没有光盘播放器，所以它的重量大大减轻了。总的来说，这是一台快速，轻便，实用的计算机，我强烈推荐它。	This Macbook Pro is AMAZING!

2178	B00L49X8E6_16_A3LBA8TGYC1CK3	I wanted a laptop on a budget just for my university teaching needs (making Word Documents, PowerPoints, Excels, PDFs - Office is not included). This laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing. The speakers are fairly basic, so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies. The touchpad is a little &amp;quot;clunky&amp;quot; for my taste; I use a small external mouse with laptops  in any event. I appreciate the relatively large keyboard (with number pad) and screen size. I also found the track pad irritating until I disabled &amp;quot;pinch zoom.&amp;quot; This is larger laptop, but is not too heavy. Battery life is great - though it is new. The power chord is a little short compared to most laptops. Overall, a solid laptop for its price.	我想要一台预算适合我大学教学需求的笔记本电脑（制作Word文档，PowerPoint，Excel，PDF-不包括Office）。这款笔记本电脑非常适合那些应用程序和基本的网络冲浪。扬声器是相当基本的，因此，如果您的主要目标是流音乐或看电影，则可能不是要购买的计算机。触摸板有点“笨拙”。为了我的口味无论如何，我都会在笔记本电脑上使用小型外部鼠标。我感谢相对较大的键盘（带数字键盘）和屏幕尺寸。我还发现触控板很烦人，直到我禁用“捏缩放”。这是更大的笔记本电脑，但不是太重。电池寿命很棒-尽管它是新的。与大多数笔记本电脑相比，电源和弦有点短。总体而言，价格稳定的笔记本电脑。	I wanted a laptop on a budget just for my university teaching needs (making Word Documents, PowerPoints, Excels, PDFs - Office is not included).

2376	B0146DD02G_26_ANONYMOUS	This is early days for a review, since I took delivery of this only today ! However, a few things are immediately occurring to me  I had read the other reviews here on amazon, but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead. Well, my first impressions are that its OK, it certainly boots up quickly (thanks SSD!), and from the limited use so far (no games) its fast enough in normal usage. It certainly looks nice, but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out. Also I have found the touch pad to be awkward to use (could be I am pressing too hard perhaps), and the screen is    well   underwhelming. To be honest I am a little disappointed and considering returning it.

4554	B0074703CM_102_ANONYMOUS	This is my first MacBook coming from a Windows environment. Like so many others who do this there is a learning curve and I'm excited to do it. This MBP is clean, neat, and simple. I like that. It takes less time to power up, and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode. WHen you open it wakes up almost immediately. Very nice.

No HDMI port. Most Windows laptops have at least 1. The headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone. Not a big deal for me, but if you Skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a Mac.

It has the latest i7 CPU with a GTX 950M for GPU, which makes this laptop blazing fast (boots up in under 5 seconds, with the help of the SSD of course). - It has 256GB SSD which is just enough for my OS, games, documents, and anything in between. It also has an extra bay for an extra HDD if you wish to add one. - It's not touchscreen! How I hate laptops with touchscreen. I don't have to pay extra for what I hate, I mean seriously, who types with their laptops and occasionally reaches out to the screen to tap it? - Its keyboard is nicely arranged, silent, and back-lit which is nice, but what I don't like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers. I have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good. - This laptop is so silent, its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load, thanks to the 5th generation Intel core which draws less power,  thus less heat. - It's comfortable to have it on my lap, because the weight is evenly distributed to he laptop's body and not accumulated on the screen like most &amp;amp;#34;hybrid&amp;amp;#34; ones do. - It can run games really well. Well, not really well. MOBAs like Dota 2 and SMITE can be run on max quality settings with 60 fps or more. Medium settings on titles like Tomb Raider for it to be acceptable (60 fps is the minimum acceptable fps #pcmasterrace). - It's lightweight and easy to carry around. - The screen is a matte 1080p display, which is nice, but with poor viewing angle. I find myself adjusting it regularly. - It looks sleek and gorgeous. Blends in with any accessory you use with it. All in all I am very happy with this purchase. And with this price, I don't think you can buy anything better.	作为计算机科学专业的学生，我真的爱上了这款笔记本电脑。有什么不喜欢的？这是15.6英寸，对我来说，这既不是太大也不是太小。它配备了最新的i7 CPU和适用于GPU的GTX 950M，这使这款笔记本电脑运行起来非常快（当然，借助SSD可以在5秒内启动）。 -它具有256GB固态硬盘，足以容纳我的操作系统，游戏，文档以及介于两者之间的所有内容。如果您想添加一个额外的硬盘，它也有一个额外的托架。 -不是触摸屏！我如何讨厌带触摸屏的笔记本电脑。我不必为自己讨厌的东西付额外的钱，我是认真的说，谁在用笔记本电脑打字，偶尔伸手触摸屏幕呢？ -它的键盘排列整齐，安静且具有背光，这很好，但是我不喜欢它的原因是这种材料会从您的手指上吸油。我必须定期清洁它，以使其保持良好状态。 -这款笔记本电脑是如此安静，其风扇只有在笔记本电脑承受重负载时才会启动，这要归功于第5代Intel内核，它消耗的功率更少，从而产生的热量更少。 -将其放在我的膝盖上很舒服，因为重量均匀地分布在笔记本电脑的身体上，而不像大多数“杂种”那样堆积在屏幕上。的。 -它可以很好地运行游戏。好吧，不是很好。像Dota 2和SMITE这样的MOBA可以在60 fps或更高的最大质量设置下运行。诸如《古墓丽影》之类的标题的中等设置都可以接受（60 fps是#pcmasterrace的最低可接受fps）。 -重量轻且易于携带。 -屏幕为磨砂1080p显示屏，虽然不错，但视角差。我发现自己要定期调整。 -看起来圆滑而华丽。与您使用的任何附件融为一体。总而言之，我对这次购买感到非常满意。而且，以这个价格，我认为您买不到更好的东西。	As a student majoring computer science, I really fell in love with this laptop.

I didn't think i would need an optical drive but since i have had it I used it several times. Installed Parallels 8 on it and windows 7 and windows 8 actually works excellent (should i provoke some people and say that i find it works better than the Mac OS).

I was considering buying the Air, but in reality, this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient, even though it's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier. I'm not sure if it was covered in the description, but it does have a backlit keyboard and I'm getting about an 8 hour battery life on one charge (Except I don't use this for games or videos, which obviously would drain the battery faster). It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid. The screen has an extremely high resolution that I'm very pleased with. Even though MacBooks are expensive, you will see that they are well worth the money. I have only used PCs in the past, and it's easy to see that Apple is just more advanced.

6930	B0074703CM_184_ANONYMOUS	My daughter's MacBook Air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago. It took 3 days to make an appointment at the local Apple store. I'm not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $129 for a new battery, $39 to replace it and $139 for a new keyboard. I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager. He explained to me the battery expansion is 'normal'. Apple doesn't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care. The battery is simply considered 'consumable' and NOT covered. I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn't consider the product defective. His reply astonished me, looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said: 'Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear! They will contact you.' He didn't specify who are 'they' but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5' posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS. Here is my take on all of this, the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China, hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school, call them geniuses, and bully everybody who complains about their product. Steve Jobs is dead, so is Apple. No more Apple devices in my household. Please Google 'MacBook battery bulge explode' before you buy your next Apple toy.	几天前，我女儿的MacBook Air电池膨胀，键盘变形。在当地的Apple商店预约了3天。我不确定接下来会发生什么，但她回家哭了，手里拿着一张纸129美元买了一个新电池，39美元用来更换电池，139美元是一个新键盘。我简直不敢相信他们认为电池没有问题，所以我亲自去了苹果商店并请了一位经理。他向我解释，电池膨胀是“正常的”。在任何情况下，即使在Apple Care的保护下，Apple也不涵盖电池扩展。电池仅被认为是“消耗性”的，没有盖好。我问经理他是否对我感到满意，并在网上发布了MacBook Air的图片，并描述了Apple认为该产品没有缺陷。他的回答让我惊讶，低头看着我戴着厚实眼镜的我说：“在涂抹之前，请确保您已经掌握了事实！他们会与您联系。他没有具体说明谁是“他们”，但是从他的语气和他的6&#39;5&#39;姿势来看，这表明特警队和一群律师之间存在着某种联系。这是我的全部观点，苹果公司现在推行的商业模式是从中国买一些便宜的垃圾，高中毕业后直接雇用一群拉拉队长，称他们为天才，并且欺凌所有抱怨他们产品的人。史蒂夫·乔布斯死了，苹果也死了。我家中没有更多的Apple设备。在购买下一个Apple玩具之前，请先让Google“ MacBook电池膨胀爆炸”。	My daughter's MacBook Air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago.

7326	B00M166GWM_0_ANONYMOUS	I purchased this laptop back in June 2015 after doing a lot of research on different laptops I was interested in. While I have only ever owned HP laptops, I made sure to look into other brands, including Asus, Dell, and Microsoft. However, the HP Envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more. I have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all. While the price may seem high, it is worth every penny with its many perks. The Pros:  A Ton of Storage Space- This laptop comes with 8GB of memory and a 1 TB (1000GB) hard drive. That is plenty of space for your laptop, which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers. I really enjoy having all of the extra space, especially coming from a laptop with only 500GB of hard drive space. 2-in-1 Capability- The ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus. If you are looking to get a 2-in-1 laptop, this is the laptop you should consider. I love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies, without having the keyboard in the way of things. However, the physical keyboard is much nicer than the detachable ones found on other laptops and tablets. I find it much easier to type on and much more durable. Battery Life- My battery life is really good with this laptop and I have had no problems with it thus far. I can usually go about 10 hours before I get down to 10% battery life. My last laptop had terrible battery life, lasting only about an hour on a full charge, so this isn't too shabby at all for a laptop. The Cons:  No Disc Drive- Call me old fashioned, but I still enjoy listening to physical CDs and uploading them to iTunes. However, I can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive. While it is entirely possible to buy a disc drive, I do not feel like it is something I absolutely need. If you are an avid CD listener though or want to watch DVDs from your laptop, I would suggest buying the separate disc drive. Overall, I definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop. The touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes. It also is nice to be able to play Candy Crush or Angry Birds when in between classes straight from your laptop. It makes it much more exciting to play!	在对我感兴趣的不同笔记本电脑进行了大量研究之后，我于2015年6月购买了该笔记本电脑。虽然我以前仅拥有HP笔记本电脑，但我确保研究其他品牌，包括华硕，戴尔和微软。但是，HP Envy绝对满足了我所有的期望以及更多。到目前为止，我对我的购买印象深刻，完全不后悔购买。虽然价格似乎很高，但值得付出的每一分钱都有很多好处。优点：大量的存储空间-这款笔记本电脑配备8GB内存和1 TB（1000GB）硬盘。笔记本电脑有足够的空间，对于大学生和计算机游戏玩家来说确实很方便。我非常喜欢拥有所有额外的空间，尤其是来自只有500GB硬盘空间的笔记本电脑。 2合1功能-轻松将笔记本电脑切换为平板电脑是一大优势。如果您要购买二合一笔记本电脑，则应考虑使用该笔记本电脑。我喜欢能够像帐篷一样将其折叠起来并观看电影而无需用键盘挡住东西的灵活性。但是，物理键盘比其他笔记本电脑和平板电脑上的可拆卸键盘好得多。我发现它更容易打字并且更耐用。电池寿命-这款笔记本电脑的电池寿命真的很好，到目前为止，我还没有遇到任何问题。通常，我可以花大约10个小时才能将电池寿命降低到10％。我的最后一台笔记本电脑的电池寿命很糟糕，充满电后只能使用一个小时，所以对于笔记本电脑来说，这一点也不算破旧。缺点：没有光盘驱动器-叫我老式，但是我仍然喜欢听物理CD并将其上传到iTunes。但是，我无法再执行此操作，因为此笔记本电脑不包含光盘驱动器。虽然完全有可能购买光盘驱动器，但我认为这并不是我绝对需要的。如果您是狂热的CD听众，或者想从笔记本电脑上观看DVD，建议您购买单独的光盘驱动器。总体而言，我绝对会向市场上有新笔记本电脑的任何大学生推荐该产品。触摸屏和二合一功能是一项巨大的优势，并且很容易随身携带。直接在笔记本电脑上课时，还能玩《 Candy Crush》或《 Angry Birds》，这也很好。玩起来更加刺激！	I purchased this laptop back in June 2015 after doing a lot of research on different laptops I was interested in.

However, the physical keyboard is much nicer than the detachable ones found on other laptops and tablets. I find it much easier to type on and much more durable. Battery Life- My battery life is really good with this laptop and I have had no problems with it thus far. I can usually go about 10 hours before I get down to 10% battery life. My last laptop had terrible battery life, lasting only about an hour on a full charge, so this isn't too shabby at all for a laptop. The Cons:  No Disc Drive- Call me old fashioned, but I still enjoy listening to physical CDs and uploading them to iTunes. However, I can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive. While it is entirely possible to buy a disc drive, I do not feel like it is something I absolutely need. If you are an avid CD listener though or want to watch DVDs from your laptop, I would suggest buying the separate disc drive. Overall, I definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop. The touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes. It also is nice to be able to play Candy Crush or Angry Birds when in between classes straight from your laptop. It makes it much more exciting to play!
7524	B0074703CM_194_ANONYMOUS	I'm actually writing this review on my new MacBook and I love it! The seller was great and I had my computer within 2 days. The computer it self is amazing. It is an older model, so know that upfront, but it is everything I was looking for. I wanted a laptop that had a CD drive, since most new laptops do not have one, a laptop with an actual hard drive, since the new MacBooks do not, and I wanted to get away from PCs. I actually spent $600 on a PC before I bought this MacBook and returned it with 24 hours because it was slow, and I could not stand windows 10. From the moment I received this MacBook it was like a dream come true. It is a little sluggish, which was to be expected with the 4GB ram, but even at its sluggish it is faster than the PC I bought. I know once I upgrade the ram to 8GB it will pick up a lot. As an added bonus I plan on upgraded to 16GB down the road, but 8 will do for now. The price for the ram is about $80 so this lap top is still cheaper than a brand new MacBook. Also, if after reading some reviews and doing some research I found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus. So long story short, if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop. I know people were complaining that it isn't the newest model, but it all depends on what you are looking for. It's the perfect size for someone who is using a laptop for school or everyday use, and while it is a little heaver than the MacBook Air, at 5ish pounds, its really not that bad. I highly recommend!!	我实际上是在我的新MacBook上写这篇评测，我喜欢它！卖家很棒，我两天内就拥有了我的电脑。电脑本身就很棒。这是一个较旧的模型，所以要预先知道，但这是我一直在寻找的一切。我想要一台带有CD驱动器的笔记本电脑，因为大多数新笔记本电脑都没有CD驱动器，一台带有实际硬盘的笔记本电脑，因为新的MacBooks没有，所以我想摆脱PC的困扰。在我购买这台MacBook并在24小时内将其退回之前，我花了600美元在PC上，因为它速度很慢，而且我无法忍受Windows 10。它有点迟钝，这在4GB的ram中是可以预期的，但是即使它呆滞，它也比我购买的PC快。我知道，一旦将ram升级到8GB，它将收到很多东西。作为额外的奖励，我计划在将来升级到16GB，但现在可以使用8GB。内存的价格约为80美元，因此这款笔记本电脑仍比全新的MacBook便宜。另外，如果在阅读了一些评论并进行了一些研究之后，我发现这台笔记本电脑易于升级且易于使用，这是另一大优点。长话短说，如果您想要老歌而不是老歌，这就是您的笔记本电脑。我知道人们一直在抱怨这不是最新的模型，但这完全取决于您要寻找的内容。对于那些在学校或日常使用笔记本电脑的人来说，它是一个完美的尺寸，虽然它比MacBook Air轻了一点，但重量仅为5磅，但还算不错。我强烈推荐！	I'm actually writing this review on my new MacBook and I love it!

7722	B0074703CM_279_ANONYMOUS	This computer is a fantastic tool for word processing, searching the internet, and keeping track of everyday life. It's also incredibly light, has a battery that can last for days, and looks like a piece of art. Though, that's pretty much what your paying for -- a well designed device. When you look at the internal specs, the computer is only worth about $500. It has a 128 GB storage capacity (but with the option of a 256 GB hard drive) and a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, so don't expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too. If your looking to be a trendy hipster who can't live without a Mac, it's a great buy. Otherwise, go with a cheaper computer or consider spending a little more for the Pro.	这台计算机是用于文字处理，搜索互联网和跟踪日常生活的绝佳工具。它的重量也令人难以置信，它的电池可以使用几天，看起来像一件艺术品。不过，这几乎就是您所付的钱-一款设计精良的设备。当您查看内部规格时，这台计算机的价值仅为500美元左右。它具有128 GB的存储容量（但可以选择256 GB的硬盘驱动器）和1.6GHz的双核Intel Core i5，因此不要指望在此计算机上玩游戏并确保您选择外接硬盘。也开车如果您希望成为一个没有Mac就无法生存的时髦潮人，那绝对是个好选择。否则，请选择价格便宜的计算机，或考虑多花一点钱购买Pro。	This computer is a fantastic tool for word processing, searching the internet, and keeping track of everyday life.

7920	B0146DD02G_11_ANONYMOUS	Got it directly from ASUS. It mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don't need. Most system now a days have something great but miss something that you will be looking for. Pros :  1. Nice Looks. If you can't afford a MacBook get this one :) 2. Keyboard is great 3. I didn't wanted a 4K or a touch display for laptop. I wanted a simple Full HD display and this one does its job 4. Sound is great 5. And this has a extra slot for HDD 6. No CD drive. Who uses one these days. Cons:  1. Web cam. VGA really ASUS?? You don't want to show this to anyone :). Anyway I don't use webcam much so , I don't care 2. Viewing angles are not great. 3. Remember its a dual core. 4. The fan kicks in even its not too hot. 5. I found the track pad not great. I use my mouse so not a problem for me. Over all very good system and worth it. Wonder its hard to get .. Getting sold on a higher price in Amazon. ASUS always shows sold out.	直接从华硕获得。它在需要的规格和不需要的规格之间达到了很好的平衡。如今，大多数系统现在都很棒，但是错过了您想要的东西。优点：1.外观不错。如果您买不起MacBook，请购买：) 2.键盘很棒3.我不想为笔记本电脑配备4K或触摸屏。我想要一个简单的Full HD显示器，这个显示器可以完成它的工作。4.声音很棒。5.它有一个用于HDD的额外插槽。6.没有CD驱动器。这些天谁用的。缺点：1.网络摄像头。 VGA真的是华硕吗？您不想将此显示给任何人:)。无论如何，我不太喜欢使用网络摄像头，所以我不在乎2。视角不是很好。 3.记住它是双核的。 4.风扇即使没有太热也会踢动。 5.我发现触控板不好。我用鼠标，对我来说不是问题。总体而言，非常好的系统值得。想知道它很难得到..在亚马逊上以更高的价格出售。华硕总是显示售罄。	Got it directly from ASUS.

8118	B00GJUQ4Z0_17_ANONYMOUS	This was the ONLY tablet-style computer so far which met my requirements. It's replacing a first generation Surface Pro that is too bulky and heavy to effectively use (my preference). I was seduced by this computer, so I took it home. The wireless keyboard (not bluetooth, but RF) did not pair up with the device. I proceeded to make all updates for Sony Vaio, including the BIOS. It still did not pair. I've used the Pairing Tool, which is located in the Windows directory. I even ran it as Administrator -- still no effect. I used the Ctrl-Esc keys while turning on, and still nothing. It's charged, the light comes on. It flickers briefly to green before the light goes out. I upgraded to Windows 8.1, and repeated the sequence on software loads. I still can't pair it. I don't want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional. I may give it one more shot tonight, then I'm returning it to the vendor. I will update it if I get it working with the procedure. I'm not playing the game of send in a computer or wait for a new keyboard, while my return window is still open. Sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while I get my money back for a DEFECTIVE product. Others have posted about this keyboard issue. But Sony doesn't seem to have addressed it. UPDATE:  after the hassle of a return, waiting in line, then sitting around the store to allow the computer and keyboard to charge sufficiently, I was able to obtain a keyboard which was paired out of the box with the computer.	到目前为止，这是唯一符合我要求的平板电脑式计算机。它取代了体积太大，笨重而无法有效使用的第一代Surface Pro（我的偏爱）。我被这台计算机所吸引，所以把它带回家。无线键盘（不是蓝牙，而是RF）未与设备配对。我继续为Sony Vaio进行了所有更新，包括BIOS。它仍然没有配对。我使用了Windows目录中的配对工具。我什至以管理员身份运行它-仍然没有效果。我在打开时使用了Ctrl-Esc键，但还是一无所获。充满电，灯亮。指示灯熄灭之前，它会短暂闪烁绿色。我升级到Windows 8.1，并在软件加载时重复了该过程。我仍然无法配对。我不想为键盘无法正常工作的计算机携带蓝牙键盘。我可能今晚再给它一个镜头，然后将其退还给供应商。如果可以使用该程序，我将对其进行更新。我的返回窗口仍处于打开状态，我没有在玩发送计算机游戏或等待新键盘的游戏。在我退还瑕疵产品的钱时，索尼可以从卖方那里负担这笔费用。其他人已发布有关此键盘问题的信息。但是索尼似乎没有解决这个问题。更新：退货的麻烦之后，排队等候，然后在商店里闲逛，以使计算机和键盘充满电，我能够获得与计算机开箱即用配对的键盘。	This was the ONLY tablet-style computer so far which met my requirements.

8712	B00M166GWM_6_ANONYMOUS	This is really nice, but I HATE the awkward right mouse clicking.. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.. may be the laptop, may be the laptop in conjunction with Windows 8?  Either way, highly annoying. I hooked up a USB mouse and all is well. All works beautifully but Windows 8 is taking a bit of getting used to. I paid the $100 for Professional version to join it to our server and private business network. Love the 360 degree rotation and the touch screen works great, but a little bit of a learning curve there too, as sometimes I have to tap a few times to get the exact location I need... overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop (the mouse was the only negative I could really see)...	这确实很好，但我讨厌用鼠标右键单击尴尬。.有时它有用，有时却不..可能是笔记本电脑，可能是与Windows 8结合使用的笔记本电脑？无论哪种方式，都非常烦人。我挂上了USB鼠标，一切都很好。一切正常，但Windows 8有点习惯了。我花了100美元购买了专业版，才能将其加入我们的服务器和私人企业网络。喜欢360度旋转，触摸屏效果很好，但是那里的学习曲线也有点，因为有时我不得不轻按几次才能获得所需的确切位置...总体来说，这只是我的一些学习比笔记本电脑的任何故障都无法实现的（鼠标是我真正能看到的唯一缺点）...

The only reason I returned it was because I bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program, it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate. I would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase. It's a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen.

9306	B0146DD02G_21_ANONYMOUS	Awesome laptop for college!!! Can be used for gaming as well. It's light, fast and has great battery!! It's a steal when considering the specs and performance as well. The processor and GPU are fantastic at running games and multiple apps. I can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed. The backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially. Make sure to only handle this computer with clean hands because the front cover can get oily pretty fast. I'm overall very pleased with my new laptop!!! The only downside are the speakers. They don't go very loud at all. The quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me. This is mostly not an issue since I mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times. The screen looked fine to me and wasn't an issue like others have been saying. Overall great for me!!!	很棒的大学笔记本电脑！！！也可以用于游戏。它轻便，快速，并且具有出色的电池！！在考虑规格和性能时也很容易。处理器和GPU非常适合运行游戏和多个应用程序。我可以运行大多数游戏，而不会感到速度不足。背光键盘特别不错。确保仅用干净的双手操作此计算机，因为前盖很快会变得油腻。我总体上对我的新笔记本电脑非常满意！！！唯一的缺点是扬声器。他们一点也不大声。声音的质量很好，但是音量不足确实使我丧命。这几乎不是问题，因为我无论如何都主要使用耳塞，但是有时可能会很烦人。屏幕对我来说看起来不错，这并不是别人一直在说的问题。总体上对我来说很棒！！！	Awesome laptop for college!!!

9702	B0074703CM_148_ANONYMOUS	I just bought this MacBook Pro a few weeks ago, and the user interface was so simple I got used to my computer in a matter of days, rather than the year it took for me to master Microsoft Windows 7. Boot time is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute. Apps launch super fast, and the 500GB HDD is more than sufficient. I usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing, so the entry-level 13' MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for. Macs hardly ever get viruses, and they are completely incompatible with existing Microsoft Windows Viruses. Furthermore, Mac OS X Mountain Lion's Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans, which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed. The keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit, which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing (Typing?). Overall, the screen resolution, though non-retina, is sufficient for normal web browsing and work. I still don't get why retina displays are standard on most new iOS devices, but are only available on the MacBook Pro with Retina Display (Total cheapskate!). The thunderbolt port is awesome! It's 10gbps transfer speeds surpass even the super-fast USB 3.0 (Which also comes with the MBP). US 3.0 comes with the MBP and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps. Other ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack. SDHC card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs. The glass track pad is large enough for Apple's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers, zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers, accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers. You can also buy one of Apple's magic mice, which connect to your Mac using Bluetooth, and also allows you to use certain multi-touch gestures such as zoom and scroll. For Windows users switching to a Mac, you can also enable right clicking (known to apple as secondary click) in the system preferences&amp;gt; Mouse and enabling right clicking. The unique to apple aluminium uni-body is a real beauty. It makes the MBP very durable and protects it from scratches, though you shouldn't go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it. For Windows users who are used to using Microsoft Office, you can buy a license for the latest Microsoft Office software for Mac (Currently 2011) at any of apple's retail stores, Apple Authorised resellers, any store that sells Microsoft Office for Mac or downloading the software directly from Microsoft's website. *Users without an optical drive can skip the installation of Microsoft Office and head to the next section* To install the software, simply insert the disc provided in the package into the optical drive and open and install all the files. Enter your code printed on the back of your CD sleeve when prompted. Done! Enjoy using Microsoft Office! *For those without an optical drive (MBP with Retina Display and MB air), read this. Users with and optical drive can skip this section* To download Microsoft Office, go to Microsoft's website and download the trial version. When prompted, enter your code printed on the back of your CD sleeve to unlock the full potential of Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac. The Mac app store and iTunes store are phenomenal. The Mac app store is your one-stop shop for Mac software, though you can also download software online at your own risk. There are currently around 10,000 apps on the App store (and counting...), and billions of songs available for download fro the iTunes store. iTunes is also you default (And also your only) media player besides DVD player, or any other media players you may come across on the internet. iTunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it's simple to use User Interface. Users switching from a PC will definitely prefer iTunes to Microsoft's Windows media player. Overall, the high price of the MacBook Pro may convince users to buy a cheaper Windows PC instead. But remember, you are paying a high premium for a product with better build quality and high quality software, which is a joy to work with, considering that you can finally work in peace without having to worry about the millions of Windows viruses out in the wild attacking countless careless and oblivious PC users. I'm sure you won't regret making this purchase.	几周前我刚刚购买了这款MacBook Pro，其用户界面是如此简单，我在几天之内就习惯了计算机，而不是花了我一年的时间来掌握Microsoft Windows7。启动时间非常快，大约从35秒到1分钟不等。应用启动速度非常快，而500GB硬盘已经绰绰有余。我通常将Mac用于学校作业和互联网浏览，因此入门级13英寸MacBook Pro已经超出了我通常会使用的计算机所期望的范围。 Mac几乎不会感染病毒，并且它们与现有的Microsoft Windows病毒完全不兼容。此外，Mac OS X Mountain Lion的Gate keeper可以防止用户下载恶意软件和特洛伊木马程序，从而确保您的数据安全和计算机以最佳速度运行。键盘上的键间隔均匀且具有背光，这使它易于在夜间使用和进行快速书写（Typing？）。总体而言，尽管不是视网膜，但屏幕分辨率足以满足正常的Web浏览和工作需求。我仍然不明白为什么视网膜显示屏在大多数新的iOS设备上是标准配置，但仅在带有Retina显示屏的MacBook Pro上可用（总便宜货！）。雷电端口很棒！它的10gbps传输速度甚至超过了超高速USB 3.0（MBP也随附）。 MBP附带US 3.0，传输速率高达5Gbps。其他端口包括FireWire 800，千兆以太网，MagSafe端口，麦克风插孔。 SDHC读卡器和光盘驱动器，用于刻录和读取光盘。玻璃触控板足够大，可用于Apple广受赞誉的多点触控手势，包括用两根手指滚动浏览网页，用两根手指双击来放大某些应用程序的某些部分，用五根手指捏住并使用任务控制键来访问启动板。用四个手指轻扫。您还可以购买Apple的其中一款魔术鼠标，它们可以通过蓝牙连接到Mac，还可以使用某些多点触控手势，例如缩放和滚动。对于切换到Mac的Windows用户，您还可以在“系统偏好设置”&gt;“启用”中启用右键单击（苹果公司称为“二次点击”）。鼠标并启用右键单击。苹果铝一体机的独特之处在于其真正的美。它使MBP非常耐用，并保护它免受刮擦，尽管您不应该为了尝试而将它撞在墙上。对于习惯于使用Microsoft Office的Windows用户，您可以在苹果的任何零售商店，苹果授权的经销商，任何销售用于Mac的Microsoft Office的商店或下载Microsoft的Mac上最新的Microsoft Office软件（当前为2011）的许可证。直接从Microsoft网站下载软件。 *没有光驱的用户可以跳过Microsoft Office的安装，然后转到下一部分。*要安装软件，只需将包装中提供的光盘插入光驱，然后打开并安装所有文件。出现提示时，输入印在CD套筒背面的代码。做完了！享受使用Microsoft Office的乐趣！ *对于那些没有光盘驱动器的用户（带有Retina显示屏的MBP和MB air），请阅读此内容。具有光盘驱动器和光盘驱动器的用户可以跳过此部分*。要下载Microsoft Office，请访问Microsoft的网站并下载试用版。出现提示时，输入印在CD套筒背面的代码，以释放Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac的全部潜能。 Mac应用程序商店和iTunes商店非常出色。 Mac应用程序商店是您购买Mac软件的一站式商店，尽管您也可以自行承担在线下载软件的风险。目前，App Store上有大约10,000个应用程序（并且还在增加……），数十亿首歌曲可以从iTunes Store下载。除了DVD播放器之外，iTunes还是您默认的（也是唯一的）媒体播放器，或者您可能会在互联网上遇到的任何其他媒体播放器。 iTunes具有易于使用的用户界面，是市场上最好的媒体播放器之一。从PC切换的用户肯定会喜欢iTunes，而不是Microsoft的Windows Media Player。总体而言，MacBook Pro的高价格可能会说服用户购买更便宜的Windows PC。但是请记住，您要为具有更好的构建质量和高质量软件的产品付出高昂的代价，这是与您一起工作的一种快乐，因为您最终可以安心工作，而不必担心其中的数百万个Windows病毒。疯狂攻击无数粗心和遗忘的PC用户。我相信您不会后悔购买的。	I just bought this MacBook Pro a few weeks ago, and the user interface was so simple I got used to my computer in a matter of days, rather than the year it took for me to master Microsoft Windows 7. Boot time is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute. Apps launch super fast, and the 500GB HDD is more than sufficient. I usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing, so the entry-level 13' MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for. Macs hardly ever get viruses, and they are completely incompatible with existing Microsoft Windows Viruses. Furthermore, Mac OS X Mountain Lion's Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans, which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed. The keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit, which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing (Typing?). Overall, the screen resolution, though non-retina, is sufficient for normal web browsing and work. I still don't get why retina displays are standard on most new iOS devices, but are only available on the MacBook Pro with Retina Display (Total cheapskate!). The thunderbolt port is awesome! It's 10gbps transfer speeds surpass even the super-fast USB 3.0 (Which also comes with the MBP). US 3.0 comes with the MBP and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps. Other ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack. SDHC card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs. The glass track pad is large enough for Apple's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers, zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers, accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers. You can also buy one of Apple's magic mice, which connect to your Mac using Bluetooth, and also allows you to use certain multi-touch gestures such as zoom and scroll. For Windows users switching to a Mac, you can also enable right clicking (known to apple as secondary click) in the system preferences&amp;gt; Mouse and enabling right clicking. The unique to apple aluminium uni-body is a real beauty. It makes the MBP very durable and protects it from scratches, though you shouldn't go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it. For Windows users who are used to using Microsoft Office, you can buy a license for the latest Microsoft Office software for Mac (Currently 2011) at any of apple's retail stores, Apple Authorised resellers, any store that sells Microsoft Office for Mac or downloading the software directly from Microsoft's website. *Users without an optical drive can skip the installation of Microsoft Office and head to the next section* To install the software, simply insert the disc provided in the package into the optical drive and open and install all the files.

10296	B0074703CM_251_ANONYMOUS	My grand daughter attends Kent State University. Seems the whole school... at an academic level... is going paperless. She had a PC. All of her professors and instructors use Macintosh. Knowing that I am a Mac fan-boy, it was a no-brainer that she asked me for this as a Christmas present. When the MacBook Pro arrived, I helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the PC to the Mac... an easy drag-and-drop process utilizing a flash drive. It was delivered with 4GB of RAM -- 2GB on each of two sticks -- which was probably adequate. However, I always recommend at least 8 gigs, so I ordered 8 gigs from Amazon. When the RAM arrived, all 8 gigs were on one stick. So I simply pulled one 2GB stick from the machine and installed the 8GB stick in its place. The machine now has 10 gigs of RAM and it works just fine. But, hey, it's an Apple. I wouldn't expect anything less!	我的大女儿上肯特州立大学。似乎整个学校……在学术水平上……正在无纸化。她有一台电脑。她的所有教授和讲师都使用Macintosh。知道我是Mac迷之后，她毫不犹豫地向我索要这作为圣诞节礼物。 MacBook Pro到货时，我帮助她将所有学业从PC转移到Mac……利用闪存驱动器轻松进行拖放过程。它提供了4GB的RAM（两个记忆棒各有2GB），这可能就足够了。但是，我总是建议至少演出8场，所以我从亚马逊订购了8场演出。当RAM到达时，所有的8场音乐会都在一根棍子上。因此，我只是从机器上拉了一个2GB的棒，然后将8GB的棒安装到位。该机器现在具有10 gigs RAM，并且工作正常。但是，嘿，这是一个苹果。我不会再期待了！	My grand daughter attends Kent State University.

10890	B0074703CM_73_ANONYMOUS	First off, AMAZING LAPTOP! I've had my fair share of mobile devices aka laptops made by HP or some other company, but this...is wonderful! Three years ago I had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great! If I were to have any technical difficulties, the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap, it was quite impressive. I myself had purchased the 750 gig drive laptop and as a DJ with thousands of songs, pictures, and other things...and after 3 years I have managed to fill around 9% of my gigs. There is SO MUCH ROOM! Pros  1. Amazing storage (both 500gig and 750gig) 2. 8 gig ram needed if you are as productive as I am (DJ, photography, movie making, etc) its quick! 3. No anti spyware needed, never had a virus and I never will 4. build solid and durable 5. bought the 3 year warranty and boy it was needed (because of my doings) Cons.  1. If you fall behind in updates, your laptop will become progressively slower, just update it...then its back to normal 2. Sometimes when I stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on, other times it is a few seconds 3. Cannot manually take battery out, unless you work for apple or have the tools Overall, it is a fantastic laptop. Mine has been though hundreds of parties, weddings, quinces, anything involving performances, it can take it! This laptop was made for art, music, beat-making, pictures, movies, graphic design. By the way, it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what I had just listed. This laptop will last you a half decade if not a full decade. Soon I will be hitting the 5 year mark and I think this thing can make it another 5 in my opinion. Get this now!!! By the way...I paid for this particular laptop roughly 2 grand...LOOK AT THE PRICE NOW!	首先，惊人的笔记本电脑！我有相当一部分惠普或其他公司生产的移动设备（也称为笔记本电脑），但这真是太好了！三年前，我购买了这个坏男孩，但它仍然运行良好！如果我遇到任何技术困难，当地的苹果和联系热线可以尽快帮助我，那真是令人印象深刻。我本人已经购买了750 gig驱动器的笔记本电脑，并作为DJ录制了数千首歌曲，图片和其他东西……三年后，我设法完成了大约9％的演出。有这么大的房间！优点1.惊人的存储容量（500gig和750gig）2.如果您要像我一样高效地工作（DJ，摄影，电影制作等），则需要8 gig RAM。 3.不需要反间谍软件，从来没有病毒，我永远也不会4.坚固耐用。5.买了3年保修，这是必要的（因为我的所作所为）。 1.如果您落后于更新，则笔记本电脑将逐渐变慢，只需对其进行更新...然后恢复到正常状态。2.有时当我盯着我的笔记本时，它需要花几分钟的时间才能启动，而其他时候是几秒钟3.无法手动取出电池，除非您是苹果公司的工作人员或拥有工具，否则总体而言，这是一台出色的笔记本电脑。我参加过数以百计的聚会，婚礼，木瓜表演，包括表演在内的一切，它都能接受！这台笔记本电脑是为艺术，音乐，节拍制作，图片，电影，图形设计制作的。顺便说一句，它附带了已经可以支持我刚刚列出的功能的应用程序和硬件。如果不是整整十年，这台笔记本电脑将使您使用五年。很快我将达到5年大关，我认为这件事可以使它再达到5年。现在得到这个！顺便说一下...我为这台特定的笔记本电脑支付了大约2英镑...现在就看价格！	First off, AMAZING LAPTOP!

I was torn between this laptop and the zenbook. Ultimately decided on this one because of the processor and having a fan ( I read a lot of reviews about the Zenbook becoming uncomfortably hot during heavy use, which doesn't make sense considering it is a laptop). I was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows 10, but it is pretty awesome.

Also, the laptop is quite, no more burnt laps, best screen display, and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over. Considered MAcBook Air also before buying this Pro, but glad bought the Pro, because I didn't fancy carrying a bunch of adapters, separate DVD player etc..... Honestly didn't see too much difference visually between this screen and the retina display, so didn't fancy paying that much premium for retina, others may fancy that, I didn't.

11880	B0074703CM_192_ANONYMOUS	The MacBook Pro with a 13.3-inch screen was the first computer I ever purchased. I had heard people speak highly of the MacBook Pro for college students, and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use. The MacBook Pro is useful for college students for many reasons: It is the cheapest product in the line of MacBook's The new operating system called Snow Leopard is installed and ready for use The battery life has increased from the last version from 4 hours to 7 hours, making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger. The criteria that I used to evaluate the MacBook Pro ranges from Reliability to simple Usability: Reliability: Throughout the past few years, I have had no problems with the MacBook Pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws. Durability: My computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it, but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it. There are also many carrying cases to purchase to have extra protection. Visibility: The screen has brightness settings that can be changed to fit different peoples needs, also the retina display is available for an extra cost if students need a higher quality of display. Usability: The MacBook Pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesn't necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers. The processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly. The MacBook Pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes: Pros:  o It usually runs very smoothly, but Apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers. o It is very cost efficient for college students compared to other options. o It has an extended battery life. o It is extremely user friendly. Cons:  o Some people don't enjoy the way the processing system runs, but don't have any issues with getting it to function. o Others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for, for example engineering majors need extra applications &amp;amp; systems to do some work, but they are easily downloadable. I hope my customer review has been useful, feel free to respond with opinions or feedback about the content of my review.	配备13.3英寸屏幕的MacBook Pro是我购买的第一台计算机。我听说人们对大学生们的MacBook Pro给予了高度评价，并且经过两年半的广泛使用并没有对此感到失望。 MacBook Pro之所以对大学生有用，有很多原因：它是MacBook Pro系列中最便宜的产品。名为Snow Leopard的新操作系统已安装并可以使用电池寿命从上一版本从4小时增加到7小时，方便大学生长时间学习而无需充电器。我用来评估MacBook Pro的标准从可靠性到简单的可用性：可靠性：在过去的几年中，关于处理系统或任何设计缺陷，我对MacBook Pro一直没有问题。耐用性：我的计算机从高处坠落，上面洒了几滴水，但只有轻巧的塑料外壳，对控制台没有造成持久的损坏。也有许多手提箱可以购买，以提供额外的保护。可见性：屏幕具有可更改的亮度设置，以适应不同人群的需求；如果学生需要更高质量的显示，还可以额外付费使用视网膜显示器。易用性：MacBook Pro非常易于使用，可由不一定对计算机有广泛了解的人使用。处理系统已经下载，应用程序非常用户友好。 MacBook Pro具有很多积极的方面，远远超过了消极的方面：优点：o通常运行非常平稳，但是Apple拥有一支优秀的支持团队，始终愿意为客户提供帮助。 o与其他选择相比，这对于大学生而言非常具有成本效益。 o延长了电池寿命。 o这是非常用户友好的。缺点：o有些人不喜欢处理系统的运行方式，但是在使其运行时没有任何问题。 o其他人的应用程序有问题，这取决于他们需要使用设备的用途，例如，工程专业的学生需要额外的应用程序和系统可以做一些工作，但是很容易下载。希望我的客户评论有用，可以随时对评论的内容发表意见或反馈。	The MacBook Pro with a 13.3-inch screen was the first computer I ever purchased. I had heard people speak highly of the MacBook Pro for college students, and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use. The MacBook Pro is useful for college students for many reasons: It is the cheapest product in the line of MacBook's The new operating system called Snow Leopard is installed and ready for use The battery life has increased from the last version from 4 hours to 7 hours, making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger. The criteria that I used to evaluate the MacBook Pro ranges from Reliability to simple Usability: Reliability: Throughout the past few years, I have had no problems with the MacBook Pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws. Durability: My computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it, but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it. There are also many carrying cases to purchase to have extra protection. Visibility: The screen has brightness settings that can be changed to fit different peoples needs, also the retina display is available for an extra cost if students need a higher quality of display. Usability: The MacBook Pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesn't necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers. The processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly. The MacBook Pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes: Pros:  o It usually runs very smoothly, but Apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers. o It is very cost efficient for college students compared to other options. o It has an extended battery life. o It is extremely user friendly.

Battery doesn't hold up to what it said in the description but I got it refurb'd and I imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price (Just a guess). Still getting used to typing on it, my palms keep hitting the mousepad and causing the cursor to jump and moving me off of where I was typing. Practice I guess. Plenty of ports and since this is my first laptop, I really don't have anything to compare it to.	我有史以来的第一台笔记本电脑，它也可以翻转成平板电脑模式，很棒。到目前为止，一切都很好。电池不能满足描述中的要求，但我对其进行了翻新，并且我想他们会换掉电池以帮助支付降低的价格（仅供参考）。仍然习惯于在上面打字，我的手掌不断敲击鼠标垫并导致光标跳转并使我离开打字位置。练习吧，我猜。大量的端口，并且因为这是我的第一台笔记本电脑，所以我真的没有什么可比拟的。	My first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also, brilliant.

12870	B00O0W450A_10_ANONYMOUS	I love this laptop. I feel like my old laptop is a total price of crap now. The batter lasts as long as claimed. I get about 5 or so hours playing the sims. I haven't really officially tested it yet, but it's a long time. I hate plugging my laptop in because I don't want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery, but with this laptop I rarely have to charge it. The touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus. The only problem I have is with windows 8. I hate windows 8. It made me sign up with Microsoft and sometimes won't let me download things that are harmful to my computer, but that's what anti virus software is for lol. The wifi rumor hasn't happened to me. The wifi works great. I think it's because I always download my windows updates as reccomended. It feels very well built. The metal is very expensive feeling. The laptop is a little more than an inch thick when closed. I'm a very weak girl and I could lift this laptop with one hand, however I'd get tired soon lol. The 15.6&amp;amp;#34; screen is not good for carrying around in your bare hands. I suggest getting a case. The waterfly cases are very good.	我喜欢这台笔记本电脑。我觉得我的旧笔记本电脑现在总价很便宜。击球持续的时间与要求的一样。我玩模拟游戏大约有5个小时左右。我还没有正式测试过，但是已经很长时间了。我不想插入笔记本电脑，因为我不想将其放在太久的位置上而会伤及电池，但是有了这台笔记本电脑，我几乎不需要充电。触摸屏反应灵敏，甚至可以与我笨拙的美元手写笔配合使用。我唯一的问题是Windows8。我讨厌Windows8。这使我与Microsoft签约，有时不让我下载对我的计算机有害的内容，但这就是防病毒软件的作用。 wifi的谣言还没有发生在我身上。 wifi很好。我认为这是因为我总是按照建议下载Windows更新。感觉很好。金属的感觉很贵。关闭时，笔记本电脑的厚度略超过一英寸。我是一个非常虚弱的女孩，可以用一只手提起笔记本电脑，但是很快我就会累了。 15.6＆＃34;屏幕不适合裸手携带。我建议得到一个案例。该waterfly案例非常好。	I love this laptop.

13662	B0074703CM_314_ANONYMOUS	The most disappointing purchase of my life! This is my first Mac. I received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after I purchased this horrible machine. Within the first few months that I bought it, there was clearly a problem with the hard drive. I had been in a training program and had only used Word on it. I went through all of the customer service options. The online customer service was awful. Gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile. No one would ever answer my question as to why I couldn't get another new Macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my Macbook was still under warranty. As a matter of fact, no matter how many times I asked that question, the employees I spoke purposely ignored it. They didn't say yes and they didn't say no, they just pretended that I never asked it, which was incredibly frustrating. I've been to the &amp;amp;#34;genius&amp;amp;#34; bar several times (they have been very nice). They have now basically replaced everything inside my machine, told me there was a problem with the hardware, so I now have a &amp;amp;#34;refurbished&amp;amp;#34; machine. Maybe I'm not being reasonable, but I don't feel that's the same as a new computer because I didn't pay for a refurbished computer. I still have weird freezing problems with it and it's pretty slow, but it's not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in. I had delusions of grandeur regarding Apple's &amp;amp;#34;great customer service&amp;amp;#34; and the &amp;amp;#34;reliability of their machines&amp;amp;#34; etc.. etc...blah...blah... I don't love PCs, but every PC I've ever owned has lasted longer than this Macbook, which costs much more than any of those Pcs. I'm sure most people's Macbooks work just fine, but FYI, if you get the factory dud, you're stuck with it and no one at Apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away.	我一生中最令人失望的购买！这是我的第一台Mac。自从购买了这台可怕的机器之后，我就收到了哑巴，除了问题外，什么都没有。在我购买它的最初几个月中，硬盘显然存在问题。我参加过一个培训计划，只在其上使用过Word。我经历了所有的客户服务选项。在线客户服务太糟糕了。给了我整整一天的时间，并把我当成一个卑鄙的人。没有人会回答我关于为什么我不能再购买另一台新Macbook的问题，因为这显然是工厂错误，而且我的Macbook仍在保修期内。事实上，无论我问多少次，我说话的员工都故意忽略了这个问题。他们没有说“是”，他们没有说“不”，只是假装我从未问过，这实在令人沮丧。我去过＆amp;＃34;天才＆amp;＃34;酒吧几次（他们都很好）。现在，他们基本上已经更换了机器内部的所有设备，并告诉我硬件存在问题，因此我现在进行了＆amp;＃34;翻新＆amp;＃34;维修。机。也许我不太合理，但是我觉得这与新电脑并不一样，因为我没有为翻新的电脑付费。我仍然有奇怪的冻结问题，它运行缓慢，但是还不够精确，我尚无法接受。我对苹果的＆＃34; Greater Customer Service＆＃34;抱有幻想。以及他们机器的可靠性＆amp;＃34;等等...等等...等等...等等...我不喜欢PC，但是我拥有的每台PC的使用寿命都比这台Macbook更长，而Macbook的价格比任何这些PC都要高得多。我敢肯定，大多数人的Macbook都能正常工作，但是仅供参考，如果您让工厂呆滞了，您就会受其困扰，而且Apple没人会关心或扔掉您所赚的钱。	The most disappointing purchase of my life!

13860	B0074703CM_224_ANONYMOUS	I was a long time PC user. Not a geek or a wonk. PC's were just cheaper had more software and were ubiquitous.

I had to decide if I was going to make a financial commitment to Windows, upgrade, buy new, change. I decided NO!  Enough was enough. I was tired or hodge lodge of software products, security updates, malware, junk and endless upgrade trauma with Windows.

14058	B0074703CM_34_ANONYMOUS	For a premium laptop sold in 2013, the Apple MacBook Pro (13 inch, base model) is about as basic as it gets: no SSD, no discrete graphics, no 1080p display, and no touch screen. But Apple does not pretend it has any of these. What it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side, Apple's OSX Mountain Lion, the sleek looks Apple always delivers, reasonable specs, good battery life, nice keyboard, and excellent trackpad. Now, the question is, who is this computer for? Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag, and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs. The average computer user will be served better by a Macbook Air, since it is faster (for basic tasks), lighter, and has a higher-res antiglare screen. The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution. This Mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair. Hard drives can be replaced, RAM can be added as needed, and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge. The processor is roughly 15% faster than the one inside the Macbook Air, which also extends this computer's usable lifespan. The fact that the screen is fairly low-res for the price (MBP 13 has a res of 1280x800, while other windows laptops have a res of 1600x900 for the same price), really detracts from my personal experience with the computer. The retina display of my iPhone 5 has indeed spoiled me, and Apple should update the screen of the MBP 13 or bring down the price of the retina model. This, added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money, detracts from the computer's value. Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer. Those looking to drop $1200 on a new laptop will have to decide if the upgradability and processor performance is worth the money over the sleeker MacBook Air. In addition, if Mac OSX is not something you enjoy using, then I would advise that you look elsewhere for a laptop. TLDR version: good, reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive.	对于2013年售出的高级笔记本电脑，Apple MacBook Pro（13英寸，基本型号）基本具备：没有SSD，没有独立显卡，没有1080p显示屏和触摸屏。但是苹果并不假装它拥有任何这些。它所具有的是在软件和硬件方面的出色可靠性，Apple的OSX Mountain Lion，Apple始终提供的时尚外观，合理的规格，良好的电池寿命，出色的键盘和出色的触控板。现在的问题是，这台计算机的用途是什么？那些想要廉价笔记本电脑的人会回避巨大的价格标签，而那些想玩最新游戏的人则永远不会使用Mac。 Macbook Air将为普通计算机用户提供更好的服务，因为它速度更快（用于基本任务），重量更轻且具有更高的防眩光屏幕。 MacBook Pro 13.3英寸笔记本电脑适合那些想要使用Mac的人，但他们对重量和屏幕分辨率的重视在于性能和可升级性。这台Mac的使用寿命比任何其他Mac都要长，这仅仅是因为它最容易升级和维修。可以更换硬盘驱动器，可以根据需要添加RAM，并且在失去充电能力后可以更换内部电池。该处理器比Macbook Air内部处理器快约15％，这也延长了该计算机的使用寿命。屏幕的价格相对较低（MBP 13的分辨率为1280x800，而其他Windows笔记本电脑的分辨率为1600x900，价格相同），这一事实确实降低了我对计算机的个人体验。 iPhone 5的视网膜显示屏确实让我宠坏了，苹果应该更新MBP 13的屏幕或降低视网膜型号的价格。再加上硬盘驱动器的速度非常慢，这降低了计算机的价值。将价格降低一百美元将使硬盘驱动器和屏幕价格合理，并使该计算机成为五星级购买产品，但就价格而言，这是一台四星级（优质）计算机。那些打算花1200美元购买一台新笔记本电脑的人将不得不决定，相对于时髦的MacBook Air，可升级性和处理器性能是否物有所值。另外，如果您不喜欢使用Mac OSX，那么我建议您在别处寻找笔记本电脑。 TLDR版本：出色，可靠的笔记本电脑，具有中等屏幕和缓慢的硬盘驱动器。	For a premium laptop sold in 2013, the Apple MacBook Pro (13 inch, base model) is about as basic as it gets: no SSD, no discrete graphics, no 1080p display, and no touch screen.

The fact that the screen is fairly low-res for the price (MBP 13 has a res of 1280x800, while other windows laptops have a res of 1600x900 for the same price), really detracts from my personal experience with the computer. The retina display of my iPhone 5 has indeed spoiled me, and Apple should update the screen of the MBP 13 or bring down the price of the retina model. This, added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money, detracts from the computer's value. Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer. Those looking to drop $1200 on a new laptop will have to decide if the upgradability and processor performance is worth the money over the sleeker MacBook Air. In addition, if Mac OSX is not something you enjoy using, then I would advise that you look elsewhere for a laptop. TLDR version: good, reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive.
14256	B0074703CM_149_ANONYMOUS	I am really sorry I bought this machine. I own a 13' air, a 15' Macbook pro (both prior generations). I was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase. I have never been to a genius bar since my first purchase (1984). This machine has made me go there 5 times and has been nothing but a continuous problem. Finally, they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement. (It's a lemon). So, I'm cooled on Mac buys. I guess those Chinese workers really are unhappy. Update November 1, 2012...    On my last visit to the Genius Bar they sent the machine in to replace the motherboard. It came back today. They did not replace the motherboard. Instead they 'tightened' a loose wire. It also has a big new scratch on the top cover. I started it up and it still has the same problem I went in to fix. So I'm going back to Genius Bar for visit #6. I think it may have to be 'Apple Don't Care' instead of Apple Care.	我真的很抱歉我买了这台机器。我拥有一个13英尺的空气，一个15英尺的Macbook pro（均为前几代产品）。自从我第一次购买以来，该产品的糟糕程度令我震惊。自从我第一次购买（1984）以来，我从未去过天才酒吧。这台机器使我去了那里5次，除了持续的问题之外，什么也没有。最后，他们将其寄送以更换主板。 （是柠檬）。因此，我对购买Mac感到冷落。我猜那些中国工人真的很不高兴。更新2012年11月1日...在我最后一次访问Genius Bar时，他们将机器送去更换主板。今天回来了。他们没有更换主板。相反，他们“拧紧”了一根松散的电线。顶盖上也有新的划痕。我启动了它，但仍然有我要修复的相同问题。因此，我将回到Genius Bar进行＃6访问。我认为可能是“ Apple无关”而不是“ Apple Care”。	I am really sorry I bought this machine.

14454	B0074703CM_157_ANONYMOUS	It was time to replace my 8 year old laptop and I decided to get a &amp;amp;#34;fancy&amp;amp;#34; Mac Book Pro. You get what you pay for, right? WRONG! If you like your Windows 7, Vista or even XP, just stick with it. Any of those are way simpler to use than Apple's Mountain Lion operating system. Mac is complicated and frustrating at moments. I watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough. I'm a small business owner and a productivity aspect is very important to me. Windows operating system is a superior product by far. It's actually very obvious. Just look at a market share between the two concepts. I should have known better.

14652	B0074703CM_257_ANONYMOUS	When I first got the computer, I noticed the tracking pad was hard to click. This was my first Mac so I wasn't familiar with how it was suppose to feel. After using my friend's computer I knew something was wrong. I took my Macbook to the Apple store and they had to replace the battery after 1 month of use since it was swelling. They tried to tell me that the battery wasn't covered by the warranty and it costs about $150 to replace. They ended up not charging me. Other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long, I'm pretty happy with the computer.	当我刚买到计算机时，我发现很难点击跟踪板。这是我的第一台Mac，所以我对它的感觉并不熟悉。使用朋友的电脑后，我知道出了点问题。我将Macbook带到了苹果商店，使用了1个月后，由于膨胀，他们不得不更换电池。他们试图告诉我，电池不在保修范围内，更换电池的费用约为150美元。他们最终不向我收费。除了电池问题和电池寿命不会过长之外，我对计算机非常满意。	When I first got the computer, I noticed the tracking pad was hard to click.

15048	B00LNFCADQ_5_ALWWKZCL1CKGD	Don't waste your money. My HP seemed great at first, then the problems started.....wireless adapter would just &amp;quot;disappear&amp;quot; and the system said it didn't have a network card. Sometimes it comes back, sometimes not. HP was NO help. The lettering wore off the keys, so you better be able to type blind. The battery lasted 12 months, then pffft.....gone. My bud had the same problem. The aftermarket battery seems better than HP's. When I had a boot up issue, the HP recovery didn't work. The disks I made wouldn't work.....HP support stated &amp;quot;we're a hardware company, not a software company.&amp;quot; Microsoft support says to contact the manufacturer....HP. Then there was a power cord recall....HP never notified us.....and we did register......never again. I had issues with ACER, but my Dell's just seem to keep going. I switched to an Apple Airbook and LOVE it. Fewer security issues, no he said, she said between the Software and hardware companies, and it works....... BTW, I have far fewer security hack issues, too. I don't have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support, search functions, or hold times.....dropped the HP and never looked back.	不要浪费你的钱。起初我的HP看起来不错，然后问题就开始了.....无线适配器只会“消失”而不会出现。并且系统说它没有网卡。有时回来，有时不回来。惠普没有帮助。字母的键会磨损，因此您最好能够键入盲文。电池使用了12个月，然后消失了。我的芽有同样的问题。售后电池似乎比HP更好。当我遇到启动问题时，HP恢复无法正常工作。我制作的磁盘无法使用。..HP支持说“我们是硬件公司，而不是软件公司”。 Microsoft支持说要与制造商联系。然后召回了电源线.... HP从未通知我们.....并且我们确实进行了注册……再也没有。我在ACER方面遇到了问题，但我的Dell似乎还在继续前进。我切换到Apple Airbook并喜欢它。她说，在软件和硬件公司之间，安全问题更少，没有他说，并且它可以工作.......顺便说一句，我也很少遇到安全黑客问题。我没有时间或意愿投入公司的技术支持，搜索功能或保留时间.....放弃了惠普，再也没有回头。	Don't waste your money.

15246	B0074703CM_6_ANONYMOUS	I gave this product 5 stars because I have been looking for a MacBook Pro for a long time and I found it here for a wonderful price. I have used this product for only 2 days, but I can't wait to use it more. I really like Mac/Apple products because of their operating system. I have been a Linux (Ubuntu and Fedora) user for a while because Windows doesn't appeal to me and it is similar to Ubuntu and Fedora but with trackpad gestures, notification center, and I can run iTunes (I couldn't get it to run on Linux). I can tweet and use Facebook from the sidebar which is really nice. I also like I have the option to push calendars, photos, and contacts to an iPad, iPod Touch, or iPhone (if I had any of those). The only thing I have had trouble with so far is transferring music to iTunes which I would have liked to do though &amp;amp;#34;Home Sharing&amp;amp;#34; (I used iTunes on a computer separate from my Linux computer) but I could not figure that out. I just ended up using my iPod to transfer my iTunes music and I re-downloaded my Amazon music (losing my ratings). I would recommend this product to anyone having trouble typing on their iOS products, though there are cheaper options; any new computer users, as it is easy to learn; and anyone who needs to be efficient, as the gestures make it very easy to multitask. I have not tried gaming on it but I have heard that Mac/Apple does not do games well. I plan on using my MacBook Pro for a long time.	我给这款产品5颗星，因为我一直在寻找MacBook Pro，而且在这里我发现它的价格低廉。我仅使用了2天，但是已经迫不及待地想要使用它。我真的很喜欢Mac / Apple产品，因为它们具有操作系统。我曾经是Linux（Ubuntu和Fedora）用户已有一段时间了，因为Windows并不吸引我，它类似于Ubuntu和Fedora，但具有触控板手势，通知中心，而且我可以运行iTunes（我无法获取它）在Linux上运行）。我可以在侧边栏上发推和使用Facebook，这真的很好。我也喜欢将日历，照片和联系人推送到iPad，iPod Touch或iPhone（如果有的话）的选项。到目前为止，我遇到的唯一麻烦是将音乐传输到iTunes，我想通过＆amp;＃34; Home Sharing＆amp;＃34; （我在与Linux计算机不同的计算机上使用iTunes），但我不知道这一点。我刚结束使用iPod传输iTunes音乐，然后重新下载了Amazon音乐（失去了评分）。我会向所有在其iOS产品上打字有困难的人推荐该产品，尽管有更便宜的选择。易于学习的任何新计算机用户；以及需要提高效率的任何人，因为这些手势使多任务处理变得非常容易。我没有尝试过游戏，但听说Mac / Apple的游戏做得不好。我计划长时间使用MacBook Pro。	I gave this product 5 stars because I have been looking for a MacBook Pro for a long time and I found it here for a wonderful price.

15444	B0074703CM_173_ANONYMOUS	When I decided to buy my first computer, I wish I had bought a Mac first. If the price doesn't deter you, you'll find it well worth it in terms of trouble-free operation. I've had it for more than a year, and I've found that no anti-virus software is needed, as long as you don't download anything without being 100% sure that it's from a legitimate source. (Updates and plug-ins should also be treated with caution; it's a good idea to Google first and see whether other users have had problems with these items.) From time to time I get the 'spinning beach ball' that holds up progress. I can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the 'Show all bookmarks' icon (the open book icon at the upper left). Once in a long while that doesn't work; in that case I turn the computer off, then on again, and sign in -- problem solved. I'll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself, and just conclude by saying that I'm delighted with my purchase. P.S.: A friend who knows a great deal about computers started with Windows; then he bought a Mac Mini. For a time he used both; now he uses his Mac exclusively. 'Nuff said?	当我决定购买第一台计算机时，我希望自己先购买Mac。如果价格没有吓到您，您会发现它在无故障运行方面非常值得。我已经使用了一年多，并且我发现不需要防病毒软件，只要您在没有100％确信它来自合法来源的情况下不下载任何内容即可。 （更新和插件也应谨慎对待；对Google来说，这是一个好主意，请先看看其他用户在使用这些产品时是否遇到了问题。）我时不时会遇到阻碍发展的“旋转沙滩球”。我几乎总是可以通过单击“显示所有书签”图标（左上角的打开的书本图标）快速修复该问题。长时间不起作用；在这种情况下，我关闭计算机，然后再次打开电源，然后登录-问题已解决。我将把更多技术方面的知识留给比我自己更有学问的人讲，最后说一句我对我的购买感到满意。 PS：一个非常了解Windows操作系统的朋友。然后他买了Mac Mini。有一段时间，他两者都用过。现在他只使用Mac。努夫说？	When I decided to buy my first computer, I wish I had bought a Mac first.
